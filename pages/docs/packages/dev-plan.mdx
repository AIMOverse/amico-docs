# Development Plan

## 1. Core Module Enhancement
    - Refine the `amico-core` engine layer for streamlined event scheduling and more robust action selection.
    - Implement advanced logging and monitoring features to track agent interactions.

## 2. Plugin Integration
    - Expand the `amico-plugins` repository with new sensors and effectors.
    - Integrate WebAssembly (WASM) sandboxing to enhance security.

## 3. Agent Layer Improvements
    - Extend the `amico-sdk` with additional agent state management options.
    - Introduce configuration parameters for flexible agent creation.

## 4. Firmware Development
    - Evolve `amico-firmware` to support more hardware device drivers.
    - Investigate lower-power consumption strategies for embedded setups.

## 5. Documentation and Testing
    - Add comprehensive examples for new modules to the `pages/docs` folder.
    - Strengthen unit testing coverage for each plugin and framework layer.

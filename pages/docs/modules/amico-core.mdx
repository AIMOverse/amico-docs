# Core Library

## Overview

The Core Library provides the core components and interfaces for Amico. It does not implement any specific functionality, but only provides the core workflow and interface for building plugins.

The Amico Community is maintaining a series of plugins that implements common functionality for Amico agents and provides basic functionality for building custom agents. These plugins are available in the [amico-mods](/docs/modules/amico-mods) crate.

# Development Guide

## Getting Started with Development

**Amico** is written in **Rust**. Before you begin developing with Amico, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Rust programming language
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

### Installing Rust

To install Rust, we recommend using `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer:

```bash [Terminal]
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. After installation, you can verify your Rust installation with:

```bash [Terminal]
rustc --version
```

This will display the installed Rust version.

## Building and Running Amico

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the Amico repository from GitHub:

```bash [Terminal]
git clone https://github.com/AIMOverse/amico
cd amico
```

### Repository Structure

The Amico repository is organized as a Cargo workspace consisting of several modules:

- **`amico`**: The main executable application
- **`amico-core`**: Core functionality for agent task scheduling
- **`amico-hal`**: Hardware Abstraction Layer for embedded devices
- **`amico-sdk`**: SDK for development with AI functionalities
- **`amico-mods`**: Modules for implementing and extending agent features

For more detailed information about each module, refer to the [Modules Overview](/docs/modules/overview).

### Building Amico

Once you have cloned the repository, you can build Amico using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system:

```bash [Terminal]
cargo build -p amico
```

This command compiles the Amico package and its dependencies. The compiled binary will be available in the `target/debug` directory.

### Running Amico

To build and run Amico in a single step, use:

```bash [Terminal]
cargo run -p amico
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Amico may require certain environment variables to function properly. If you encounter errors about missing environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, you'll need to set them in your terminal:

```bash [Terminal]
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Next Steps

# Running Amico

## Prerequisites

### Rust

Amico is built with Rust, so you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust via `rustup`:

```bash [Terminal]
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. After installation, you can verify your Rust installation with:

```bash [Terminal]
rustc --version
```

This will display the installed Rust version.

### System Requirements

#### Officially Supported Operating Systems

1. Ubuntu amd64 / arm64
2. Raspbian arm64
3. Arch Linux amd64

#### Future Supported Operating Systems

1. Android arm64 (Near future)
2. Debian amd64 / arm64 (Near future)
3. iOS arm64
4. Windows amd64
5. macOS amd64 / arm64

#### Future Supported Platforms / Architectures

1. WASM (Near future)
2. RISC-V

### Required Dependencies

Depending on your operating system, you may need to install additional dependencies:

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash [Terminal]
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev
```

#### Arch Linux

```bash [Terminal]
sudo pacman -S base-devel openssl
```

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the Amico repository from GitHub:

```bash [Terminal]
git clone https://github.com/AIMOverse/amico
cd amico
```

### Building Amico

Once you have cloned the repository, you can build Amico using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system:

```bash [Terminal]
cargo build -p amico
```

This command compiles the Amico package and its dependencies. The compiled binary will be available in the `target/debug` directory.

### Running Amico

To build and run Amico in a single step, use:

```bash [Terminal]
cargo run -p amico
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Amico requires certain environment variables to function properly. The most important one is the `OPENAI_API_KEY` for AI capabilities:

```bash [Terminal]
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Missing API Key**: If you see an error about a missing API key, ensure you've set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- **Build Failures**: Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed for your operating system.

## What is Amico?

Amico is an Event-based Autonomous AI Agent Framework written in Rust tailered for embedded AI devices and multi-agent systems. It is designed with high scalability and flexibility for customization, while remains simple to use and deploy autonomous AI agents on all-kinds of devices.

Amico is natively integrated with the Solana ecosystem, enabling AI agents to autonomously make decisions and take on-chain actions.

Amico offers a comprehensive set of features, some hightlights including:

- Ideal for deploy Autonomous AI agent in a variaty of scenarios, with tailered support for embedded devices
- Support for multi-agent collaboration & coordination
- Autonomous AI agents with on-chain actions capabilities
- Low-Code development & deployment with runtime support

### Key Features

- **Event-based Autonomous AI Agents**

  - The concept of "Event" is an abstraction in Amico framework, refering to any external triggers that can be the inputs to AI Agent. This abstraction enables agents to respond to all-kinds of signals without human intervention.

  - AI agent built with Amico are capable of making decisions autonomously based on events, the external environment, and their internal knowledge base, requiring no human input.

- **Designed for Embedded Devices**

  - Thanks to the Rust language's support and security for embedded systems, a one-click deployment runtime, and plug-in capabilities for calling hardware modules, Amico can be adapted to almost any consumer-grade electronic hardware with end-side AI capabilities (Check out amico-firmware, and build customzied plugin for hardware).

  - Any consumer-grade end-side ai hardware that uses Amico can directly use Amico's on-chain interaction module with the functionality of a Depin device.

- **Support for Multi-Agent Collaboration & Coordination**

  - Amico enables privacy-preserving communication between agents, fostering safety, trustibility,and decentralization within the agent community.
  - For certain critical scenarios, full/partial consensus between autonomous AI agents can be achieved through Amico's multi-agent system, ensuring optimal decision-making.
  - Proof-of-Agenthood (PoA) is a consensus mechanism we are working on, which aims to prove actions & decisions are made by the agent automously, rather by human, and hence fostering an Agent-native SWARM Polis.

## What is Amico?

Amico is an Event-based Autonomous AI Agent Framework written in Rust, tailored for embedded AI devices and multi-agent systems. It is designed with high scalability and flexibility for customization, while remaining simple to use and deploy autonomous AI agents on all kinds of devices.

Amico is natively integrated with the Solana ecosystem, enabling AI agents to autonomously make decisions and take on-chain actions.

Amico offers a comprehensive set of features, some highlights including:

- Ideal for deploying Autonomous AI agents in a variety of scenarios, with tailored support for embedded devices
- Support for multi-agent collaboration & coordination
- Autonomous AI agents with on-chain action capabilities
- Low-Code development & deployment with runtime support

### Use Cases

- **Event-based Autonomous AI Agents**

  - The concept of "Event" is an abstraction in the Amico framework, referring to any external triggers that can be the inputs to an AI Agent. This abstraction enables agents to respond to all kinds of signals without human intervention.

  - AI agents built with Amico are capable of making decisions autonomously based on events, the external environment, and their internal knowledge base, requiring no human input.

- **Designed for Embedded Devices**

  - Thanks to the Rust language's support and security for embedded systems, a one-click deployment runtime, and plug-in capabilities for calling hardware modules, Amico can be adapted to almost any consumer-grade electronic hardware with end-side AI capabilities (Check out `amico-firmware`, and build customized plugins for hardware).

  - Any consumer-grade end-side AI hardware that uses Amico can directly use Amico's on-chain interaction module with the functionality of a DePIN device.

- **Support for Multi-Agent Collaboration & Coordination**

  - Amico enables privacy-preserving communication between agents, fostering safety, trustworthiness, and decentralization within the agent community.
  - For certain critical scenarios, full/partial consensus between autonomous AI agents can be achieved through Amico's multi-agent system, ensuring optimal decision-making.
  - Proof-of-Agenthood (PoA) is a consensus mechanism we are working on, which aims to prove actions & decisions are made by the agent autonomously, rather than by humans, and hence fostering an Agent-native SWARM Polis (stay tuned, and we welcome your input!).

## Key Features

- **Agent DID System**
  - Agent DID is an special Solana NFT which serves as the on-chain identity of an agent. This id records, verifies, and enables the actions made by the agent. It is integrated with Amico framework, so ai devices running Amico can directly use it to interact with the on-chain world.
  - For more technical details and design philosophies regarding Agent DID, refers to [AiMoverse Docs/Agent DID](https://aimoverse.gitbook.io/aimoverse/technical-deepdive/agent-did).
- **P2P Agent Communication**
  - Amico supports P2P agent communication, which allows agents to communicate with each other directly, without the need for a central server. It is designed to be secure, reliable, and scalable using nostr protocol.
  - For more technical details and design philosophies regarding P2P Agent Communication, refers to [AiMoverse Docs/P2P Agent Communication](https://aimoverse.gitbook.io/aimoverse/technical-deepdive/a2a-communication).
- **Agent-of-Things (AOT)**
  - Amico supports Agent-of-Things (AOT), which allows agents to interact with physical devices, such as sensors, actuators, and other devices remotely through IoT protocols, even the devices are not running Amico.
  - For more technical details and design philosophies regarding Agent-of-Things (AOT), refers to [AiMoverse Docs/Agent-of-Things (AOT)](https://aimoverse.gitbook.io/aimoverse/technical-deepdive/agent-of-everything-aoe).

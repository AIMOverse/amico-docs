# Overview

## Introduction to Amico

### What is Amico?

Amico is a next-generation Autonomous AI framework and runtime designed for embedded devices and multi-agent systems. It is natively integrated with the Solana ecosystem, enabling AI agents to autonomously make decisions and take on-chain actions.

Built on top of the [Rig framework](https://rig.rs), Amico offers a comprehensive set of features, including:

- Autonomous AI runtime for embedded devices
- Support for multi-agent systems
- Autonomous AI for on-chain actions
- Proof-of-Agenthood (PoA) utilizing Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and consensus mechanisms

### Core Concepts

- **Autonomous AI**: AI agents capable of making decisions independently, without human intervention.
- **Proof-of-Agenthood (PoA)**: A consensus mechanism for verifying the authenticity and trustworthiness of AI agents.

### Key Features

- **Environmental Awareness**
  - Amico runs natively on embedded devices, allowing agents to sense and interpret the real world. The agents can interact with their environment and make decisions accordingly.
  - The framework enables agents to control their "bodies" and perform physical actions in the real world.
- **Autonomous Decision Making**

  - Amico agents make decisions autonomously, requiring no human input.
  - **Proof-of-Agenthood** ensures the verification and trust of agents, using Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and consensus mechanisms, whether in embedded devices or distributed multi-agent systems.

- **Native Web3 Integration**

  - Amico integrates seamlessly with the Solana ecosystem, allowing agents to have their own wallets and autonomously interact with the Solana blockchain.
  - The framework also supports other major Web3 ecosystems, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and others.

- **Task-Oriented AI Agent Runtime**

  - The Amico runtime uses time-based task scheduling, enabling agents to make decisions at designated times for specific tasks.
  - During each task, the agent gathers information from the real world, including social media, news, weather, and other real-time data sources, to supplement its knowledge base and make informed decisions.

- **Multi-Agent Consensus**
  - Amico facilitates communication between autonomous agents, fostering decentralization within the agent community.
  - For certain scenarios, partial consensus mechanisms can be used, instead of requiring full agreement among all agents.
  - These consensus mechanisms also play a critical role in the Proof-of-Agenthood system.

## Architecture Overview

### Task Execution Workflow

- **Event-Triggered Task**

  - Tasks are triggered by various events, such as timers, major on-chain or off-chain events, or signals from other agents.
  - Each event carries context, which is then used as an additional knowledge source when the agent gathers information.

- **Knowledge Acquisition**

  - The agent collects relevant knowledge from its internal knowledge base as well as the context of the event.
  - If needed, the agent can also acquire real-time data from on-chain or off-chain sources.
  - The agent synthesizes all this information into a comprehensive report to guide its decision-making process.

- **Decision Making**

  - Using the knowledge report, the agent evaluates possible actions and makes an informed decision.
  - The agent can either respond to the user, execute a task, or do both.
  - For critical decisions, the agent may seek consensus from other agents to ensure the reliability of the decision.

- **Execution of Decision**

  - The agent carries out the chosen action, which could range from executing a transaction to posting content (e.g., a tweet).
  - If the action requires consensus, the agent will first consult with other agents before proceeding.

- **Agent Response**
  - Following execution, the agent can provide feedback to the user, similar to a chatbot's response.
  - This response could also include instructions for an embedded device, such as triggering a motor or adjusting the environment in some way.

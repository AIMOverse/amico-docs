# Getting started

## Installing Standalone Runtime

You can install the Amico standalone runtime using the following command:

```bash [Terminal]
cargo install amico
```

## Start Building Using Core Library

To start building your own Autonomous AI agent runtime using the Core Library, you will need to set up a new project using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo_new.html).

```bash [Terminal]
cargo new <your-project-name> --bin
```

Once you have a new project, you can add the Core Library as a dependency using the following command:

```bash [Terminal]
cargo add amico-core
```

## Building Your Plugins

To build your own plugins, you will need to set up a new project using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo_new.html).

```bash [Terminal]
cargo new <your-plugin-name> --lib
```

All the plugins should follow the [Plugin Development Guide](/docs/packages/overview) and implement our plugin interface.

```bash [Terminal]
cargo add amico-plugin-interface
```
